# Quiz -burst Real -Time Multiplayer Quiz Application  with Adaptive Gameplay

> **Abstract** : QuizBurst is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and host real-time multiplayer quizzes, where participants can join using a unique game code and compete in a live, timed environment. Unlike traditional quiz platforms, it includes features like adaptive difficulty, anti-cheating tools (tab switch detection, shuffled options), multimedia questions (text, image, audio), blind leaderboard mode, and instant explanations after each question. Players donâ€™t need to log in, and hosts can access performance analytics and export results. Built with React.js, Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB/Firebase, QuizBurst blends learning and fun into an engaging, responsive web platform.
